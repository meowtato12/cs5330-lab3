# CS5330 - Lab 3: LEGO Object Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on training a YOLOv8 model for LEGO piece detection using a custom dataset. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset structured in YOLO format, leveraging Colab for training and inference. The goal is to develop an efficient object detection model that can accurately detect and classify LEGO pieces in images.

## Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Extraction and verification of dataset structure.
- **Model Training**: Training YOLOv8 on a custom LEGO dataset with optimized parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculation of precision, recall, mAP, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Display of annotated images and model predictions on test images.
